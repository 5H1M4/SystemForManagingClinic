The site must work flawlessly on both laptops/desktops and mobile devices (mobile-first design). It should cover the client’s original requirements and include extra dynamic features to address scenarios the client may not have considered.

1. User Roles & Access Control

SuperAdmin:

Can create and manage multiple Clinics.
Has full control over global system settings and user management.
Clinic Admin:

Manages one clinic’s data including Clients, Doctors, Appointments, Doctor Schedules, Payments, and Services.
Registers Clients with fields: First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, and Email (if available).
Registers Doctors with: First Name, Last Name, Username, and Password.
Sets up and manages the clinic’s available services (with prices) and doctor schedules.
Schedules Appointments (see below) and processes Payments once appointments are completed.
Accesses dynamic dashboards and reports (e.g., monthly/yearly revenue, appointment statistics, and doctor performance).
Doctor:

Logs in to view their personal appointment calendar.
Can mark appointments as completed or update availability (e.g., marking days as on leave).
Receives real-time notifications regarding appointment changes or cancellations.

 Client Portal:

Although client registration is handled by the Clinic Admin, an optional lightweight client portal can let clients view their appointment details, receive reminders, and even request rescheduling via notifications.
2. Core Functionalities

Clinic & User Management:

SuperAdmin can create new clinics; Clinic Admin manages clinic-specific users and settings.
Robust registration forms with both client-side and server-side validation.
Role-based access control ensuring each user only accesses permitted functions.
Client Management:

Clinic Admin can add, edit, search, and filter client records.
Each client record contains basic contact information and history.
Doctor Management:

Clinic Admin registers doctors and assigns them to the clinic.
Allows for editing doctor profiles and scheduling details.
Doctor Scheduling & Availability:

Clinic Admin defines each doctor’s working hours, available time slots, and off-days.
The system must enforce that appointments cannot be created for a doctor without a defined schedule.
(Dynamic) Allow doctors to update their availability in real time.
Appointment Scheduling:

Clinic Admin schedules appointments by choosing a client, selecting a doctor (only from those with active schedules), picking a date/time, and assigning one or more services.
The system validates doctor availability and prevents double-booking.
Supports dynamic rescheduling and cancellations.
(Dynamic) Automated notifications (via SMS/email) sent to doctors, clients, and clinic staff regarding upcoming appointments, changes, or cancellations.
Services Management:

Clinic Admin creates and updates a list of services with corresponding prices.
These services are selectable when scheduling appointments and later included in payment records.
Payments Module:

Payments are recorded only after an appointment has been marked as completed.
Each payment record includes the associated services.
Capability to generate and view monthly or yearly payment history.
(Dynamic) Payment status updates (e.g., if an appointment is cancelled, the payment record can be voided or rescheduled).
Dashboard & Reporting:

A dynamic, interactive dashboard for Clinic Admins showing:
Appointment statistics (daily, monthly, yearly).
Revenue trends and payment histories.
Doctor performance and client activity metrics.
Customizable reporting tools with filtering options (by date, doctor, service type).
3. Additional Dynamic Features & User Scenarios

Notifications & Reminders:

Automated SMS/email reminders for upcoming appointments.
Real-time alerts for any appointment rescheduling or cancellations.
Configurable notification settings per user role.
Calendar Integration:

Sync appointment data with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar) for doctors and Clinic Admins.
Mobile Responsiveness & UX Enhancements:

A mobile-first responsive design ensuring intuitive navigation on both mobile and desktop.
Use of modals, alerts, and adaptive menus to streamline user interactions.
Accessibility features (e.g., proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, clear error messages).
Optional Client Self-Service Portal:

Although client records are maintained by the Clinic Admin, offer an opt-in client portal where clients can:
View their scheduled appointments and history.
Receive notifications and reminders.
Request appointment rescheduling (subject to clinic approval).
Security & Data Privacy:

Implement HTTPS, secure session management, and input sanitization.
Enforce role-based access with proper authentication and authorization.
Log user actions for auditing purposes.
Multi-Language Support:

Provide support for at least English and Albanian, given the client’s origins.


. Technical & Deployment Specifications

Frontend:

Use modern frameworks React to build a dynamic, component-based UI.
Ensure a responsive design with media queries and flexible grids.
Backend:

Use Node.js  to build a robust RESTful API.
Use a relational database PostgreSQL to store user, appointment, payment, and service data.
Provide clear documentation for API endpoints and database schema.

Deployment: im using vercel so make sure the configurations are there when i push it to GitHub then deploy it on vercel


Code Quality:

Ensure modular, maintainable, and well-documented code.
